# Phone-Images-Backup
Backup Android Phone Camera Directory 
Android Version: 8.0.0
The default setup is to copy and not delete files. You may UN-comment a section of the script to obtain the delete feature. You're responcible for this feature once activated. I take no responsability for its use.
Check the script against your phone's directory and modify the script accordingly.
